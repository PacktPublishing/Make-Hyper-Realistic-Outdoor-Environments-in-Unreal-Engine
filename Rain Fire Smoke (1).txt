A common question is how to create rain and fire in Unreal.

I don't want this course to get too bulky for those of you who don't need this, so here are some of my favorite tutorials on the topic:

Rain Particles by Josh - GameÂ Dev - https://youtu.be/2dpFtqlWt1o

Basic Fire by Jackson's Games - https://youtu.be/7mH4rQj5Whc

If there is a need, I will create shorter, more concise tutorials on these topics. Please reach out to me if that is the case.
